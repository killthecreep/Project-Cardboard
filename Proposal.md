Project Carboard

Concept:
    Your friend texted you saying he made quote, "The sweetest fort you have ever seen you gotta come over". Unfortunately you had to study for your exams and didn't make it over. It's been a few days and you haven't heard from him since... You head over there to check up on him, finding his fort. The problem is the fort seems bigger on the inside then it is on the outside, with no sign of your friend anywhere, but something is calling you into the fort...
